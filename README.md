## About this test

1) You have to create a set of APIs with native PHP7 or using a framework, allowing a consumer to create their own wishlist and add products.

2) In addition, please develop a command (CLI) able to export on CSV file the wishlist of all users.
CSV file format: user;title wishlist;number of items

The project must run through a docker and be testable through unit tests.

Load the project on github or send it as a zip.

Bonus: protect the routes with the authentication.

Time limit: 1 week / 10 days - asap is better :)
